# Complexity Analyzer Program

## Description

This project aims to provide a comprehensive static code analysis tool specifically designed for Kotlin projects. It leverages algorithms to detect code smells, enforce coding standards, and ensure high-quality Kotlin code.

## Overview

The Complexity Analyzer Program is made in Java the application is designed to analyze the complexity of given Kotlin files,
by that I mean it counts the number of named keywords after the program is done it will output the names
of the given files, the three most complex functions(functions with the biggest complexity score).

## Installation and Running the Program(You should have java installed on your machine)

1. Clone the Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine using Git(Or Download the zip file of the repository).
   
2. Navigate to the Project Directory: Change into the project directory you can put all of your Kotlin files in the codebases directory.

3. Open the project directory in Command Prompt(Windows)/Terminal(Linux) depends of your operating system.

4. To run the code first compile it using the command: javac Main.java, then use the command: javac Main.java codebases.
